## 📋 TO COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT

Since the project is already on Vercel, you need to trigger a new deployment to get the latest code:

### Option 1: Auto-deploy via Git Push (Recommended)
Vercel should automatically deploy when you push to the repository. The push was successful, so wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel to detect the changes and deploy automatically.

### Option 2: Manual Trigger via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select the "bol-new" project
3. Go to the "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

OR

1. Go to Settings → Git
2. Click "Trigger Deploy"

### Option 3: Create New Deployment via Git
Make a small change and push:
```bash
cd /path/to/bol.new
echo "\n# Deployment trigger" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger deployment"
git push origin master
```

### If Admin Tabs Show "Failed to load"
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Check Console for errors
3. Check Network tab for failed API calls
4. Verify token is being sent with requests

### If No Links Showing
1. Create a new link first
2. Refresh the page
3. Check that user ID matches in database

## 📞 SUPPORT

If issues persist after deployment:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs at https://vercel.com/dashboard
