---

## Current Blockers

1. **Backend Migration**: Flask app needs to be updated to use Supabase client instead of SQLAlchemy
2. **Frontend**: No existing React components for admin panel - need complete build
3. **Auth Integration**: Need to integrate Supabase Auth with existing session-based auth
4. **Email System**: No email service configured - need SMTP or SendGrid
5. **Testing Infrastructure**: No tests exist - need to build from scratch

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. Update Flask app to use Supabase client
2. Create authentication middleware with Supabase JWT
3. Implement core user management APIs with pagination

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Build User Management admin tab (highest priority)
2. Implement approval workflow
3. Create subscription verification interface
4. Fix Telegram integration

### Medium-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Complete all 8 admin tabs
2. Implement all API endpoints
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Create email notification system

### Long-term (Month 1)
1. Complete testing suite
2. Performance optimization
3. Security hardening
4. Production deployment

---

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 1 Backend Developer (Flask + Supabase)
- 1 Frontend Developer (React + Tailwind)
- 1 Full-Stack Developer (Integration)
- 1 QA Engineer (Testing)

### Tools & Services
- Supabase (Database + Auth) - Already provisioned
- Vercel (Deployment) - Available
- SendGrid (Email) - Need to configure
- Sentry (Error Tracking) - Recommended
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD) - Recommended

---

## Conclusion

This is an **enterprise-grade project** requiring approximately **6-8 weeks** of development time with a dedicated team. The current codebase has some foundation (user/campaign models, basic admin routes) but needs significant enhancement to meet all specified requirements.

**Priority Order:**
1. Complete backend API migration to Supabase
2. Build User Management tab with approval workflow
3. Implement RBAC middleware
4. Create Support Ticketing system
5. Build Security Monitoring dashboard
6. Implement Subscription Verification
7. Complete remaining admin tabs
8. Add comprehensive testing

The database schema is ready. Now we need to build the application layer on top of it.
