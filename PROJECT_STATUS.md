## 🔧 Technical Debt

### Current Issues
1. **Mixed Database Approach:** Code uses both SQLAlchemy (SQLite) and Supabase - needs consolidation
2. **No Frontend Build System:** Unclear how React components are built and deployed
3. **Missing Route Files:** Some routes referenced in docs don't exist (auth.py, links.py, etc.)
4. **No Tests:** Zero test coverage
5. **Hardcoded Credentials:** Default admin password in code (security risk)

### Recommended Fixes
1. Complete migration to Supabase
2. Set up proper Vite build pipeline
3. Create missing route files
4. Add comprehensive test suite
5. Use environment variables for all secrets

## 💡 Key Insights

### What's Working Well
1. **Database Schema:** Extremely well-designed with proper RLS and indexes
2. **Documentation:** Comprehensive and actionable
3. **Foundation Code:** Good structure and organization
4. **Supabase Setup:** Already provisioned and configured

### What Needs Attention
1. **Backend-Frontend Gap:** Backend is Flask, but frontend build process unclear
2. **Scope Creep Risk:** This is a 6-8 week project, not a 1-week sprint
3. **Resource Constraints:** Needs dedicated full-stack developer(s)
4. **Testing Strategy:** Need to add testing from the start, not at the end

## 📞 Recommendations

### For Immediate Progress
1. **Focus on Backend First:** Get Supabase integration working
2. **Build One Tab at a Time:** Start with User Management
3. **Use Component Library:** Consider React Admin or Refine framework
4. **Parallel Development:** Backend and Frontend can progress simultaneously

### For Long-Term Success
1. **Hire Dedicated Team:** This is too large for one person
2. **Set Realistic Timeline:** 6-8 weeks minimum
3. **Implement CI/CD:** Automated testing and deployment
4. **Plan for Maintenance:** Budget for ongoing support
