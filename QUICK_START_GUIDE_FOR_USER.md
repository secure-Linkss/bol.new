### STEP 1: Configure Vercel (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project "bol.new"
3. Click "Settings" â†’ "Environment Variables"
4. Add these variables:

```

SECRET_KEY=ej5B3Amppi4gjpbC65te6rJuvJzgVCWW_xfB-ZLR1TE

SHORTIO_API_KEY=sk_DbGGlUHPN7Z9VotL

SHORTIO_DOMAIN=Secure-links.short.gy

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_test_key_here

STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_test_key_here

APP_URL=https://bolnew-sigma.vercel.app
```

5. Set environment to "Production"
6. Click "Save"
7. Wait for auto-redeploy (or click "Redeploy" if needed)

### STEP 2: Test Your Deployment (10 minutes)

1. **Go to:** https://bolnew-sigma.vercel.app

2. **Login:**
   - Username: `Brain`
   - Password: `Mayflower1!!`

3. **Test these features:**
   - [ ] Dashboard loads (no errors)
   - [ ] Click "Tracking Links" tab
   - [ ] Click "+ Create Link" button
   - [ ] Enter any URL and campaign name
   - [ ] Submit - verify link is created
   - [ ] Go to "Campaign" tab
   - [ ] Verify campaign auto-created
   - [ ] Go to "Geography" tab
   - [ ] Verify map displays (not blank)
   - [ ] Click profile avatar (top right)
   - [ ] Verify dropdown appears
   - [ ] Refresh page (F5)
   - [ ] Verify no white screen

4. **Check metrics:**
   - Dashboard "Real Visitors" number
   - Links section "Real Visitors" number
   - âœ… Should match!

### STEP 3: Optional Stripe Setup (Later)

For now, Stripe is in test mode. When ready for production:

1. Get real Stripe API keys from https://stripe.com
2. Update Vercel environment variables
3. Create products in Stripe dashboard
4. Configure webhook endpoint

## ðŸŽ‰ That's It!

If all tests pass, your deployment is successful!

## ðŸ“Š What's Available Now

### New API Endpoints (Backend Ready):

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### If geography map is blank:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify data exists in TrackingEvent table
- Test endpoint: `/api/analytics/geographic-distribution`

### If metrics don't match:
- They should now! If not, clear cache and refresh
- Check browser network tab

### If white screen on reload:
- Clear browser cache
- Check Vercel deployment logs
- Verify latest code is deployed

### If Stripe doesn't work:
